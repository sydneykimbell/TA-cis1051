Demo code showed in lab for cis1051 students in Fall 2022

### Lab 2 - Mad Libs
Create a Mad Libs game using user input and output the story using string formatters.

### Lab 3 - Enhanced Business Card
Print out a business card using an input function to obtain first name, last name, and email. Output using a print function that is passed in the user data. The input function should call the output function.

### Lab 4 - Triangle Detection
Use two methods to correctly categorize 3 segments as 'triangle or 'not a triangle'. The first method should satisfy the conditional statement discusses in lab and the second method should rely on Heron's formula to categorize the segments.

### Lab 5 - Currency Converter
The converter should take in as user input the amount of money, currency type, and currency type to convert to. This converter should take in USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, or BRL and convert to USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, or BRL.

### Lab 6 - Dice Simulation
Get user input to determine the number of trials. Then simulate rolling two dice and adding the sum for the desired number of trials. Print out a table with number, number of rolls, and percent. In part 2, pick a random number between 2 and 12 (inclusive) and create the same table. Compare the results. Then, create 2 new programs adding columns for 'expected' and 'difference' to each table.
