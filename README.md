Demo code showed in lab for cis1051 students in Fall 2022

### Lab 2 - Mad Libs
Create a Mad Libs game using user input and output the story using string formatters.

### Lab 3 - Enhanced Business Card
Print out a business card using an input function to obtain first name, last name, and email. Output using a print function that is passed in the user data. The input function should call the output function.

### Lab 4 - Triangle Detection
Use two methods to correctly categorize 3 segments as 'triangle or 'not a triangle'. The first method should satisfy the conditional statement discussec in lab and the second method should rely on Heron's formula to categorize the segments.

### Lab 5 - Currency Converter
The converter should take in as user input the amount of money, currency type, and currency type to convert to. This converter should take in USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, or BRL and convert to USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, or BRL.

### Lab 6 - Dice Simulation
Get user input to determine the number of trials. Then simulate rolling two dice and adding the sum for the desired number of trials. Print out a table with number, number of rolls, and percent. In part 2, pick a random number between 2 and 12 (inclusive) and create the same table. Compare the results. Then, create 2 new programs adding columns for 'expected' and 'difference' to each table.

### Lab 7 - Password Checker
Ask user to enter password and verify that it is valid, following the requirements on Canvas. If the password is not valid, ask the user to enter a new password until they enter one that is valid. After the user enters a valid password, ask them to reenter the password. Verify that it matches the first password.

### Lab 8 - Lists
Program 1: Hardcode the states and capitals lists, using the data from capitals.txt as reference. Then ask the user to enter a state and print the respective capital.
Program 2: Read in the data from the file to create the states and capitals lists. Then use the same code from program 1 to ask the user to enter a state and print the respective capital.
Program 3: Read in the data from the file (like in program 2) and then create a game to quiz the user on states and capitals. First, ask the user if they want to be quizzes on states or capitals. Then, generate a random state/capital and continue until the user says to stop.
