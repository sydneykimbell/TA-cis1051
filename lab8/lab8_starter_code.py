# program 1:

# hard code the states and capitals lists, referencing the data from capitals.txt
states = []
capitals = []

# ask user to enter a state, then print out the capital of that state
# you can create a linear search function or use index() to get the index of the state, then print the capital at that index


# program 2:

# first, read in the file
with open('filename', 'r') as file:
    pass # split the file by line here

# then use the same code from program 1

# program 3:

# read in the file, same as program 2
# then create a game to quiz the user on states and capitals
